        <h3>About This Campaign</h3>
        <p> MIT Engineers Without Borders is actively working with the community in Mkutani, Tanzania, a rural farming village. The village has one primary school that serves approximately 650 students, a third live too far away to go home for lunch during the school day. Therefore, many students are unable to meet their nutritional needs for their growth and development, and school attendance is hindered.</p>

        <p>With your help, MIT-EWB plans to build an irrigated vegetable garden on the school grounds this coming summer! The project will include a shallow well near the local riverbank, a pump powered by a solar array, a pipe leading to a water storage tank, and a perforated pipe irrigation system. Students will also have the opportunity to hand water their own portion of the garden to learn about agricultural practices through hands-on experience. Ultimately, our objective is to improve food insecurity and nutrition for the school children while simultaneously providing an educational tool for the school. It is with help of generous donors like you that we are able to complete this work!</p>
